reversing-a-string
The string reverse technique refers to the change in the order of characters of a given string so that the
last character of the string gets changed with the first character and so on. In other words, swapping occurs.

This concept can be used to check the palindrome. 

A palindrome is a string that remains the same when reversed.

So, a palindrome string will have the same value even after we reverse it.
